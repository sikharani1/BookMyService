The data for the app will be accessed using a restful service to the API at “Google My business”. This is a public API with lots of great documentation. Upon return of the data (in JSON format) the image and information like contact, office location, unique features highlighted in the details section, pricings, ratings/reviews regarding the different service providers for the service selected will display; different fragments will be used to display the information needed and the contact the service provider selected. This app will also have a feature that will allow the app to email the project instructions to the user, and a  SQLite database (future scope) to keep track of the bookings the user has completed. The app does not need access to the Internet while the user is offline or something, as it is downloaded in its entirety. 


In summary ,this app will 
•	Provide the one stop solution for all your day to day work
•	User can search for a service and view the service providers
•	retrieve data from an API like Google My Business using restful services
•	use fragments to display information on various pages within the app
•	allow the user to share the service with someone (or themselves)
•	use the options menu to select the different services offered within the app 

Future Scope:
•	If time permits I will implement the app to allow the user to not only view but also book the services
•	use a database to store user data and the information about the current services booked by the user


Market Research:
In USA, there are Apps like Just dial which provides detailed quotes for different types of services, but they are limited to few areas of service we plan to extend it to many other departments as well which were never explored before, secondly we will also provide the comparison between the different services so that the user can easily choose what they want. We also will filter and display those service providers who are verified expert professionals.   




What makes my app different:
	All the services available to search in one app
	Guaranteed quality of service 
	Certified ,Background verified expert professional services
	Easy and quick to book
	Transparent and affordable price
